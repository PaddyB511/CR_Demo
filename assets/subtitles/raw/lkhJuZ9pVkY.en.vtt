00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
Phew.  So, guys, I nailed this
 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.149 align:start position:0%
Phew.  So, guys, I nailed this
board <00:04:00.147><c>and </c><00:04:00.775><c>it </c><00:04:01.403><c>was </c><00:04:02.031><c>really </c><00:04:02.659><c>hard.  </c><00:04:03.287><c>I </c><00:04:03.915><c>didn't</c>

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
board and it was really hard.  I didn't
 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.670 align:start position:0%
board and it was really hard.  I didn't
think <00:04:05.419><c>that </c><00:04:06.679><c>simply</c>

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
think that simply
 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.390 align:start position:0%
think that simply
hammering <00:04:08.259><c>nails </c><00:04:08.838><c>was </c><00:04:09.417><c>so </c><00:04:09.996><c>difficult.  </c><00:04:10.575><c>Now, </c><00:04:11.154><c>when</c>

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
hammering nails was so difficult.  Now, when
 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.190 align:start position:0%
hammering nails was so difficult.  Now, when
I <00:04:11.786><c>did </c><00:04:12.172><c>this, </c><00:04:12.558><c>it </c><00:04:12.944><c>was </c><00:04:13.330><c>very </c><00:04:13.716><c>noisy, </c><00:04:14.102><c>and </c><00:04:14.488><c>I </c><00:04:14.874><c>was</c>

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
I did this, it was very noisy, and I was
 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.789 align:start position:0%
I did this, it was very noisy, and I was
worried <00:04:15.879><c>about </c><00:04:16.558><c>my </c><00:04:17.237><c>neighbors,</c>

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
worried about my neighbors,
 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.509 align:start position:0%
worried about my neighbors,
and <00:04:19.191><c>that </c><00:04:19.583><c>they </c><00:04:19.975><c>would </c><00:04:20.367><c>scold </c><00:04:20.759><c>me.</c>

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 align:start position:0%
and that they would scold me.
 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.390 align:start position:0%
and that they would scold me.
So <00:04:22.023><c>I </c><00:04:22.527><c>thought </c><00:04:23.031><c>I'd </c><00:04:23.535><c>just </c><00:04:24.039><c>nail</c>

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
So I thought I'd just nail
 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.629 align:start position:0%
So I thought I'd just nail
this <00:04:24.931><c>board.  </c><00:04:25.462><c>And </c><00:04:25.993><c>here, </c><00:04:26.524><c>right </c><00:04:27.055><c>here </c><00:04:27.586><c>I </c><00:04:28.117><c>will</c>

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.029 align:start position:0%
this board.  And here, right here I will
not <00:04:29.263><c>do </c><00:04:29.887><c>anything.  </c><00:04:30.511><c>Let </c><00:04:31.135><c>it </c><00:04:31.759><c>stand</c>

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 align:start position:0%
not do anything.  Let it stand
 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.909 align:start position:0%
not do anything.  Let it stand
like <00:04:32.439><c>this.  </c><00:04:32.839><c>Well, </c><00:04:33.239><c>it's </c><00:04:33.639><c>okay.  </c><00:04:34.039><c>But </c><00:04:34.439><c>I</c>
